How successful were you with your game?
My game, on a technical level, turned out well.
Each node is its own method and each calls the next method based on user input,
so the main class etc. only needs the first few methods and the game handles itself.
Gameplay-wise, it's a little bare, and it doesn't have a very interesting story or a ton of content.
