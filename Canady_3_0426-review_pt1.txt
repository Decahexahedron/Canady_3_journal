Write a Java method to return the cubed value of some number.

public int cube(int x){
	int placeholder = x;
	x = x * placeholder;
	x = x * placeholder;
	return x;
}

Write an Arduino function to return the cubed value of some number.

int cube(int x){
	int y = x;
	int z = y * x;
	int result = z * x;
	return result;
}

Create the class, an object, and class constructor for class student

class Student{
	String name;
	int grade;
	boolean passing;
	boolean work;
	Student(int x, int y, String name){
		if(this.work){
			this.grade++;
		}
		if(this.grade >= 70){
			this.passing = true;
		}
		
	}
}

public Student student1;

student1 = new Student(100, 100, "Rhys");



Describe - if we were to continue with Arduino - what would you create?

since we already finished the piano, we wanted to have buttons to switch octaves, and maybe even LEDs for each note, then that porject would be mostly done.
Me and Aldo were going to use Gemmas or ATTiny arduinos to produce high-frequency sounds to scare of hooligans in the halls, and we would be started on that if the computer liked the USB ports etc.
