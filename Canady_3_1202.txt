Were /you/ successful? Why or why not?
Yes, I was successful. My game works well at a technical level(even though I redid most of it in 2 days).
The story is meh and the gameplay is pretty decent.
One playthrough of the game can be very short (or a reasonable amount less short) depending on their choices,
so the full experience would include playing through a couple times and finding out what each choice does.
