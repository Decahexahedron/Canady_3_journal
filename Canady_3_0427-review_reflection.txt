The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli).
Memorization - the regurgitation of facts - is considered the lowest level of learning.
Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
CS can not really be accomplished with only memorization.
You have to actually learn, since writing Java requires problem solving and troubleshooting.
Memorizing syntax / basic info is only the first 10% or so of learning the language.

What should students learn from CS?
We need to learn OOP and concepts like abstraction. encapsulation, etc.
