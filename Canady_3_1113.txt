How will you use while loops in your game? Why?
I can put the whole game (and/or induvidual nodes) in a while loop so they can repeat;
i.e. starting over the game or restarting the node because they gave a bad input
How will you use methods in your game? Why?
I'm pretty sure Mr. Davis wants us to use a method for each node so it's simpler to put in ifs and while loops
