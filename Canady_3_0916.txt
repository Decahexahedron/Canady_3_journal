What are the three guiding rules / principles for this class?
1.Tinker
2.Helping others helps you

articulating ideas helps your understanding. It is proven through research that cellphones are BAD for productivity.
What does that look like in practice?
You can come up with your own solutions and unique ways to do things, understand your own understanding better through articulation, and be productive without cellphones.
