What are strings?
a string is a datatype that can contain letters, numbers, characters, etc.

What are they good for?
Any time you need to store/use info that isn't number or boolean (like a user's name or a keyboard input)

What are some string methods?
substring and length
Substring makes a small chunk of the string, so str.substring(0,2) would return the first 2 characters of string str

How do we identify string methods?
they use syntax stringname.method()
for example, name.substring(0,2)
or str.length() //is technically an int that is the character length of the string
