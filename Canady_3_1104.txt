What is a method?
A method is like a little program. It does one specific task, so you can use it whenever you need to that task in your program.

Which methods did you use and how did you use them in your guessing game program?
I just used a method for the actual game, and put that method in the while loop so it only ran while they had tries. 
It let them guess and told them if their guess was right or wrong.

What is a while loop?
A while loop checks for a certain thing. Whenever that thing is happening, whatever is inside the while loop will do its job. 
The entire time that thing is happening, it will do whatever's in the loop, not just once. 

How did you use a while loop, boolean, and counter in your guessing game? 
I used a while loop to check if the user had any tries left, and while they had tries, it would run the game. 
I used a boolean to determine if the game should keep going or not. I used a counter to keep track of how many tries they had left.
