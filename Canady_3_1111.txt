In your game, what challenges must your player solve?
Generally making the right decision is a challenge, where the wrong decision usually results in a worse part of the possibilities, or the player dying

How will you specifically track whether they have been solved?
Lots of booleans??

Provide variable names and types. Classes if applicable.
public int progress //tracks how far the player is, using while loops so if the player types an invalid response, it will repeat that node
A boolean for pretty much every node, so it will give the player the correct node
