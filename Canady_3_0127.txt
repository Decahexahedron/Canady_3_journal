How do you add an image to a slick game?
You should give something its own class so it's not just an image, but a thing, then give it an Image, then you would draw it with render(). 

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.] 
It is drawn in render(), e.g.:
sprite.draw((int) Player.x, (int) Player.y);
or something like:
g.draw(player.rect);
