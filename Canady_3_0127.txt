How do you add an image to a slick game?
You should give something its own class so it's not just an image, but a thing, then give it an Image, then you would draw it with render().:
Image currentImage;
    Shape hitbox;
    Image ninja = new Image(
            "res/d22_ninja.png");
    this.currentImage = ninja;

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.] 
It is drawn in render(), e.g.:
sprite.draw((int) Player.x, (int) Player.y);
or something like:
g.draw(player.rect);
