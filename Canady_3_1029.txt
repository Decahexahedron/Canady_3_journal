Is your guessing game a game? Why or why not?
It sorta is..? It has a win and lose scenario, so technicallly it is, but it doesn't do much else.

What would make it better?
I could add a system of multiple tries, or make it so there is an option to continue on a win-streak if you get it right.
That would make it more fun, probably.
