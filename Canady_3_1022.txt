What is the purpose of the code art that you create?
At this point, we need to be fluent/comfortable with methods and have a good understanding JavaFX, so this project was a good
way to put those into practice.

What is the purpose of creating art with code to learn?
You have a lot of freedom for creativity with art, so you can do what you want, so it helps with learning because we have to 
learn exactly what we want to make, instead of having to just figure out how to do it exactly one way.
