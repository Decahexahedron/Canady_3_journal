For what computational reason did you type elf64?
elf64 is a format I'm pretty sure, to use with nasm (the command for assembly??))

Why did you use ld?
ld is used to compile (i googled most of this)

Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?
chmod changes the file's permissions (i knew this from cyberpatriot) so you could use it

Now - change the code to print your name. You should change the program so that it actually prints your name.


Post the code in your journal


What problem did you have to solve to get it to work?


Given your actual experience with Assembly now --- Is assembly 'quick and easy'? Why or why not?


What does 'low level' actually mean with regards to programming languages?
