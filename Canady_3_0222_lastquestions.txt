We will have a test on friday. It will be about the notes from last week. Are you ready?
Yes totally ez
What specific questions do you have about the slick game?
None, my game works
We will be revising our Slick game to: 
1.Have multiple levels
2.Enemies
3.Traps (or something) defined by an array
4.Give and take damage
5.Score
6.Inventory or some compelling alternative.
What will you have to do to get this working?
Are you prepared? Do you have all the knowledge you need?
Levels are ez, enemies are already in the base Unwavering (i need to give them gravity tho)
I already have some traps but i could move them to an array
Damage is super easy you just need an attack
I already have score
Inventory will be interesting but adding collectibles will be fun
I am prepared, I have most of the knowledge I need but idk how to do inventory
