What slick game did you create?
I created (almost) a platformer called Dungeon Challenge (not the best name but w/e)

What challenges did you solve?
I figured out how ot implement checkpoints, score, deadly objects, and ladders.

Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
Yes, because tiled is easy and we had so much time on the break.

Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not? [Focus on what you did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.
I finished most of it on the weekend, so I didn't really make the timeline during the week, but I had everything but gravity (that's pretty important though ;-;)
