What is a class constructor?
A constructor is related to a class, used for making objects, and looks like:
public ClassName(thingsThatItIsPassed){
    set stuff to be equal to things
}
You make an object by calling the constructor with new, like
objectName = new ClassName(arguments that were created by the constructor I think);

What should be included in a class constructor for orbs? Why?
We would need a hitbox (probably ints for hitboxX and hitboxY or hitboxWidth and hitboxHeight) and location (ints for x and y), also an int or float for damage.

What methods should the orb have? why?
They could have a subtractHealth() or doDamage() method to damage the player,  and something like tracking() or move() to make it move to the player.
